<i>Word frequency histograms find extensive application across different domains, including natural language processing, content analysis, SEO, linguistics, education, and information retrieval. They play a crucial role in analyzing text data, identifying significant keywords, comprehending language patterns, optimizing content, and enhancing search engine rankings. By unveiling word distribution, frequency trends, and language usage insights, these histograms facilitate decision-making processes and improve language learning outcomes. Overall, word frequency histograms serve as versatile tools with diverse practical utilities, providing valuable insights into textual data.</i><br>

<b>Code explanation of 'Wordhistogram.js' component</b> inside components folder.
This code is a React component called Wordhistogram that creates a word frequency histogram and offers the functionality to fetch word frequency data from a text file and export it as a CSV file.

Let's go through the code step by step:

The code imports the necessary dependencies, including React, useState, and useEffect from the React library, and Chart from the chart.js library, which is used for rendering the histogram.

The <b>Wordhistogram component</b> is defined as a functional component. It initializes two state variables using the useState hook: histData to store the word frequency data and loading to keep track of the loading state of the data.

The useEffect hook is utilized to trigger the rendering of the histogram whenever the histData state changes. It checks if histData is not empty and calls the renderHistogram function.

The <b>datafetch function</b> is an asynchronous function that retrieves data from the URL 'https://www.terriblytinytales.com/test.txt'. It processes the fetched text data by splitting it into words, counting the frequency of each word, and sorting the word-frequency pairs in descending order. The top 20 word-frequency pairs are then stored in the sortedData array, which becomes the new value for the histData state. Any errors that occur during the fetch or processing are caught and logged to the console. Finally, the loading state is set to false to indicate that the data fetching is complete.

The <b>exportToCSV function </b> is triggered when the user clicks the export button. It prepares the CSV content by constructing a comma-separated string containing the headers and rows of the word-frequency data. This string is then encoded and used to create a data URI for the CSV file. A <a> element is created, given the data URI, and appended to the document body. It is then programmatically clicked to initiate the download of the CSV file. Finally, the <a> element is removed from the document body.

The <b>changeHistogram function </b> is responsible for rendering the histogram using the Chart.js library. It retrieves the chart's canvas element by its ID, extracts the labels (words) and data (word frequencies) from the histData state, and creates a new instance of the Chart.js library with the necessary configurations to display a bar chart.

The component's JSX markup is returned. If histData is empty, a button is displayed to fetch the data. The button is disabled when loading is true. When the data is available, the word-frequency pairs are shown in a <div>. Additionally, an export button is provided to download the data as a CSV file. Finally, a canvas element with the ID histogram-chart is rendered, where the histogram will be displayed.

In summary, this component allows users to retrieve word frequency data from a text file, view the top 20 word frequencies in a list, visualize them as a histogram, and export the data as a CSV file. <br>
